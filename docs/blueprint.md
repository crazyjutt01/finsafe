## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Mint cream (#F5FFFA), a very desaturated tint of the primary color to establish a clean background
- Accent color: Sky blue (#87CEEB) to complement the green, creating a calming effect.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for a clean, modern and approachable look, well-suited to financial data.
- Use flat style icons to represent various categories such as food, travel, shopping, and bills, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding.
- The layout should be clean and intuitive, with a focus on readability. Important information such as budget status and spending summaries should be prominently displayed.
- Subtle animations to enhance user experience and provide feedback for user interactions (e.g., progress bar filling up smoothly, gentle transitions between views).
